# Section 2: Phase 1 Development - Creating the Basic Riddle App

## **Overview**
In this section, we'll build the foundation of Zoo Safari - a working app that families can use to solve riddles and track their progress. By the end of this section, you'll have a functional web app running on your computer.

## **What We're Building in Phase 1**

✅ **Welcome screen** - Families enter their name
✅ **Riddle display** - Shows animal riddles with hints
✅ **Manual completion** - "I found it!" button (no QR scanning yet)
✅ **Points tracking** - Simple scoring system
✅ **Digital Zoo collection** - List of discovered animals

---

## **Step 1: Create the Next.js Application**

### **Create the App:**
1. **Open Terminal in VS Code** (Ctrl+` or View > Terminal)
2. **Make sure you're in the right folder**:
   ```
   pwd
   ```
   Should show your `zoo-safari-mvp` folder path

3. **Create the Next.js app**:
   ```
   npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
   ```
   
4. **When prompted, answer**:
   - Use TypeScript? **No**
   - Use ESLint? **Yes**
   - Use Tailwind CSS? **Yes**
   - Use `src/` directory? **Yes**
   - Use App Router? **Yes**
   - Would you like to customize the default import alias? **No**

5. **Wait for installation** (this takes 2-3 minutes)

### **Test the App:**
1. **Start the development server**:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and go to: `http://localhost:3000`

3. **You should see** a Next.js welcome page with spinning logo

4. **Stop the server**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal when ready to continue

**✅ Success checkpoint: You have a working Next.js app!**

---

## **Step 2: Clean Up and Create Basic Structure**

### **Clean the Default Files:**

1. **Open** `src/app/page.js` in VS Code
2. **Replace all content** with this simple version:

```javascript
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-green-50 p-4">
      <div className="max-w-md mx-auto">
        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-center text-green-800 mb-8">
          🦁 Zoo Safari
        </h1>
        <p className="text-center text-gray-600">
          Your adventure starts here!
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

3. **Save the file** (Ctrl+S)

### **Test Your Changes:**
1. **Start the server again**: `npm run dev`
2. **Open browser**: `http://localhost:3000`
3. **You should see**: A green page with "Zoo Safari" title

**✅ Success checkpoint: Your app shows the Zoo Safari welcome screen!**

---

## **Step 3: Create the Welcome Screen Component**

### **Create the Welcome Form:**

**Replace** `src/app/page.js` with this code (you can copy-paste):

```javascript
'use client'
import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Home() {
  const [familyName, setFamilyName] = useState('')
  const [gameStarted, setGameStarted] = useState(false)
  const [currentPoints, setCurrentPoints] = useState(0)
  const [discoveredAnimals, setDiscoveredAnimals] = useState([])

  const startAdventure = () => {
    if (familyName.trim()) {
      setGameStarted(true)
      // Save family name to browser storage
      localStorage.setItem('zooSafariFamilyName', familyName)
    }
  }

  if (!gameStarted) {
    return (
      <div className="min-h-screen bg-green-50 p-4">
        <div className="max-w-md mx-auto pt-20">
          <div className="text-center mb-8">
            <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-green-800 mb-4">
              🦁 Zoo Safari
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
              Ready for an amazing animal adventure?
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6">
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">
              What's your family name?
            </h2>
            <input
              type="text"
              value={familyName}
              onChange={(e) => setFamilyName(e.target.value)}
              placeholder="Enter family name..."
              className="w-full p-3 border border-gray-300 rounded-lg text-lg mb-4"
            />
            <button
              onClick={startAdventure}
              disabled={!familyName.trim()}
              className="w-full bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 disabled:bg-gray-400 text-white font-semibold py-3 px-6 rounded-lg text-lg"
            >
              🚀 Start Adventure!
            </button>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-green-50 p-4">
      <div className="max-w-md mx-auto">
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-800 mb-4">
          Welcome, {familyName} Family!
        </h1>
        <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6">
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Points: {currentPoints}
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Animals discovered: {discoveredAnimals.length}
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### **Test the Welcome Screen:**
1. **Save the file**
2. **Refresh your browser** (the page should auto-refresh)
3. **Test the form**:
   - Try clicking "Start Adventure" without entering a name (button should be disabled)
   - Enter a family name and click "Start Adventure"
   - You should see the welcome message with your family name

**✅ Success checkpoint: Families can enter their name and see a personalized welcome!**

---

## **Step 4: Add the First Riddle**

### **Add Riddle Data and Logic:**

**Replace** your `src/app/page.js` with this expanded version:

```javascript
'use client'
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

// Sample riddles for our MVP
const sampleRiddles = [
  {
    id: 1,
    animal: 'Lion',
    riddle: "I'm the king of the jungle, but I don't live in trees.\nMy mane shows my power, and my roar brings all to their knees.\nI live with my family in a pride so strong,\nFind my kingdom - but don't take too long!",
    hint: "Look for the biggest cats with golden fur!",
    difficulty: 'easy',
    points: 100,
    fact: "Male lions can roar so loud it can be heard 5 miles away!"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    animal: 'Elephant',
    riddle: "I'm the largest land animal, with memory so keen,\nThe biggest ears on Earth help keep me clean.\nMy trunk has 40,000 muscles, strong yet so gentle,\nI can pick up a peanut or lift something substantial!",
    hint: "Look for the animal with the longest nose!",
    difficulty: 'medium',
    points: 150,
    fact: "Elephants can live up to 70 years and never forget their friends!"
  }
]

export default function Home() {
  const [familyName, setFamilyName] = useState('')
  const [gameStarted, setGameStarted] = useState(false)
  const [currentPoints, setCurrentPoints] = useState(0)
  const [discoveredAnimals, setDiscoveredAnimals] = useState([])
  const [currentRiddleIndex, setCurrentRiddleIndex] = useState(0)
  const [showHint, setShowHint] = useState(false)
  const [showSuccess, setShowSuccess] = useState(false)

  // Load saved data when app starts
  useEffect(() => {
    const savedFamily = localStorage.getItem('zooSafariFamilyName')
    const savedPoints = localStorage.getItem('zooSafariPoints')
    const savedAnimals = localStorage.getItem('zooSafariAnimals')
    
    if (savedFamily) {
      setFamilyName(savedFamily)
      setGameStarted(true)
    }
    if (savedPoints) {
      setCurrentPoints(parseInt(savedPoints))
    }
    if (savedAnimals) {
      setDiscoveredAnimals(JSON.parse(savedAnimals))
    }
  }, [])

  const startAdventure = () => {
    if (familyName.trim()) {
      setGameStarted(true)
      localStorage.setItem('zooSafariFamilyName', familyName)
    }
  }

  const foundAnimal = () => {
    const currentRiddle = sampleRiddles[currentRiddleIndex]
    const newPoints = currentPoints + currentRiddle.points
    const newAnimals = [...discoveredAnimals, {
      ...currentRiddle,
      discoveredAt: new Date().toISOString()
    }]

    setCurrentPoints(newPoints)
    setDiscoveredAnimals(newAnimals)
    setShowSuccess(true)

    // Save to browser storage
    localStorage.setItem('zooSafariPoints', newPoints.toString())
    localStorage.setItem('zooSafariAnimals', JSON.stringify(newAnimals))
  }

  const nextRiddle = () => {
    setShowSuccess(false)
    setShowHint(false)
    if (currentRiddleIndex < sampleRiddles.length - 1) {
      setCurrentRiddleIndex(currentRiddleIndex + 1)
    }
  }

  if (!gameStarted) {
    return (

# Section 3: Home Testing Setup

## **Overview**
Now that you have a working riddle app, it's time to test it with real families in a controlled environment. This section will help you validate the core user experience and gather feedback before approaching zoos for pilot programs.

## **What We're Accomplishing**
✅ **Create a home testing environment** with printed riddle stations
✅ **Test the complete user experience** with friends and family
✅ **Gather feedback** on riddle difficulty and engagement
✅ **Validate our core assumptions** about family learning and fun
✅ **Prepare materials** for zoo partnership conversations

---

## **Step 1: Expand Your Riddle Collection**

First, let's add more riddles to make the testing experience more robust.

### **Add More Sample Riddles:**

**Replace** the `sampleRiddles` array in your `src/app/page.js` with this expanded version:

```javascript
// Expanded riddles for home testing
const sampleRiddles = [
  {
    id: 1,
    animal: 'Lion',
    riddle: "I'm the king of the jungle, but I don't live in trees.\nMy mane shows my power, and my roar brings all to their knees.\nI live with my family in a pride so strong,\nFind my kingdom - but don't take too long!",
    hint: "Look for the biggest cats with golden fur!",
    difficulty: 'easy',
    points: 100,
    fact: "Male lions can roar so loud it can be heard 5 miles away!"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    animal: 'Elephant',
    riddle: "I'm the largest land animal, with memory so keen,\nThe biggest ears on Earth help keep me clean.\nMy trunk has 40,000 muscles, strong yet so gentle,\nI can pick up a peanut or lift something substantial!",
    hint: "Look for the animal with the longest nose!",
    difficulty: 'medium',
    points: 150,
    fact: "Elephants can live up to 70 years and never forget their friends!"
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    animal: 'Giraffe',
    riddle: "I'm the tallest animal, reaching up so high,\nMy long neck helps me eat leaves in the sky.\nMy spots are unique, like a fingerprint true,\nI'm gentle and peaceful - I'd love to meet you!",
    hint: "Look up! I'm the tallest animal in the world!",
    difficulty: 'easy',
    points: 100,
    fact: "A giraffe's tongue is 18-20 inches long and dark purple to protect it from sunburn!"
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    animal: 'Penguin',
    riddle: "I wear a tuxedo but can't fly in the air,\nI waddle on land and swim without care.\nI slide on my belly when I want to go fast,\nIn the cold, icy world, my fun times can last!",
    hint: "Look for the bird that swims better than it flies!",
    difficulty: 'easy',
    points: 100,
    fact: "Penguins can swim up to 22 mph and hold their breath for 20 minutes!"
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    animal: 'Monkey',
    riddle: "I swing from branch to branch with greatest ease,\nI love to eat bananas and play in the trees.\nI'm smart and curious, I love to explore,\nWatch me hang upside down and maybe I'll do more!",

    points: 100,
    fact: "Some monkeys can use tools and have been seen using sticks to get insects!"
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    animal: 'Tiger',
    riddle: "I'm orange and black with stripes so bold,\nI'm a hunter so fierce, or so I've been told.\nI'm the largest wild cat, strong and so sleek,\nI love to swim - quite rare and unique!",
    hint: "Look for the striped cat that loves to swim!",
    difficulty: 'medium',
    points: 150,
    fact: "Unlike most cats, tigers love water and are excellent swimmers!"
  }
]
```

**Save and test** - you should now have 6 different riddles to work through!

---

## **Step 2: Create Physical Testing Stations**

### **Design Home Testing Setup:**

**Create a simple "home zoo" experience:**

1. **Choose 6 locations** in your home/yard for "animal stations":
   - **Living room** = Lion habitat
   - **Kitchen** = Elephant watering hole  
   - **Back yard** = Giraffe tall trees
   - **Bathroom** = Penguin ice cave
   - **Bedroom** = Monkey tree house
   - **Garage** = Tiger jungle

2. **Create station signs** (print these out):

### **Station Sign Template:**

**Create these signs using any word processor or even handwrite them:**

```
🦁 LION KINGDOM
----------------------------------------
"The King of Beasts Lives Here"

This station represents the African savanna
where lions roam in family groups called prides.

[Place this sign in your living room]
```

```
🐘 ELEPHANT WATERING HOLE  
----------------------------------------
"Giants of the Land Gather Here"

This station represents the watering holes
where elephant families come to drink and play.

[Place this sign in your kitchen near sink]
```

```
🦒 GIRAFFE TALL TREES
----------------------------------------  
"Reaching for the Sky"

This station represents the tall acacia trees
where giraffes feed on high leaves.

[Place this sign in back yard or tallest room]
```

```
🐧 PENGUIN ICE CAVE
----------------------------------------
"Tuxedo Birds of the South"

This station represents the icy Antarctic
where penguins slide and swim.

[Place this sign in bathroom - coolest room]
```

```
🐵 MONKEY TREE HOUSE
----------------------------------------
"Swingers of the Forest"

This station represents the jungle canopy
where monkeys play and explore.

[Place this sign in a bedroom]
```

```
🐅 TIGER JUNGLE
----------------------------------------
"Striped Swimmers of Asia"

This station represents the Asian jungles
where tigers hunt and swim.

[Place this sign in garage or basement]
```

## **Step 3: Test with Real Families**

### **Recruit Test Families:**

**Invite 3-5 families with children ages 4-12:**
- Neighbors with kids
- Friends with families  
- Siblings/relatives with children
- Church or community group families

### **Testing Instructions for Families:**

**Give each test family these instructions:**

```
📱 ZOO SAFARI HOME TEST

Welcome to Zoo Safari! You're helping us test a new app
that makes zoo visits more fun and educational.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. One family member opens this link on their phone: 
   http://localhost:3000 
   (Make sure your computer is running the app)

2. Enter your family name and start the adventure

3. Read each riddle carefully and work together to solve it

4. When you think you know the answer, go find that 
   "animal station" in the house

5. When you find the right station, tap "I Found It!" 
   in the app

6. Celebrate and read the fun fact together!

7. Continue until you've found all 6 animals

We'll be observing and taking notes, but please act 
naturally and have fun!
```

---

## **Step 4: Data Collection During Tests**

---

## **Step 5: Conduct Testing Sessions**

### **Testing Session Structure (45-60 minutes each):**

**Pre-Test (5 minutes):**
- Welcome family, explain they're helping test a new app
- Show them the "animal stations" around your home
- Give them the phone with app loaded
- Start your observation timer

**During Test (30-40 minutes):**
- **Observe but don't help** unless they're completely stuck
- **Take notes** on engagement, discussion, collaboration
- **Time each riddle** completion
- **Listen for** educational conversations and excitement

**Post-Test Interview (10-15 minutes):**
- **Ask open-ended questions**:
  - "What was your favorite part?"
  - "What would make this more fun?"
  - "Would you want to use this at the zoo?"
  - "What did you learn about animals?"
  - "How was working together as a family?"

### **Key Things to Watch For:**

✅ **Positive Indicators:**
- Families discussing riddle clues together
- Children teaching parents animal facts
- Excitement when solving riddles  
- Requesting to "do another one"
- Natural movement between stations
- Learning conversations happening

❌ **Warning Signs:**
- One person dominating the experience
- Children losing interest mid-riddle
- Confusion about what to do next
- Frustration with riddle difficulty
- Adults taking over instead of collaborating

        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }
```

## **Step 2: Add Difficulty Variety for Adult/Child Testing**

### **Expand Riddles with Mixed Difficulties:**

**Replace your `sampleRiddles` array** with this expanded version that includes easy, medium, and hard riddles:

```javascript
// Expanded riddles with varied difficulty for comprehensive testing
const sampleRiddles = [
  // EASY RIDDLES (Ages 4-8)
  {
    id: 1,
    animal: 'Lion',
    riddle: "I'm big and yellow with a fluffy mane.\nI roar really loud - can you hear my refrain?\nI'm called the king, but I live on the ground.\nCan you find where my roar can be found?",
    hint: "Look for the biggest, loudest cat!",
    difficulty: 'easy',
    points: 50,
    fact: "Lions live in groups called prides, like big families!"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    animal: 'Elephant',
    riddle: "I'm really big and colored gray.\nMy nose is long - I use it all day!\nI flap my ears to stay nice and cool.\nFinding me would be really cool!",
    hint: "Look for the biggest animal with a long nose!",
    difficulty: 'easy',
    points: 50,
    fact: "Elephants use their trunks like we use our hands!"
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    animal: 'Monkey',
    riddle: "I love bananas, they're my favorite treat!\nI swing on branches with hands and feet.\nI'm playful and silly, I love to have fun.\nCan you find me before the day is done?",
    hint: "Look for the animal that swings and plays!",
    difficulty: 'easy',
    points: 50,
    fact: "Monkeys can hang upside down by their tails!"
  },

  // MEDIUM RIDDLES (Ages 8-12)
  {
    id: 4,
    animal: 'Giraffe',
    riddle: "I'm the tallest animal, reaching up so high,\nMy long neck helps me eat leaves in the sky.\nMy spots are unique, like a fingerprint true,\nI'm gentle and peaceful - I'd love to meet you!",
    hint: "Look up! I'm the tallest animal in the world!",
    difficulty: 'medium',

    fact: "Penguins can swim up to 22 mph and dive 500 feet deep!"
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    animal: 'Tiger',
    riddle: "Orange and black stripes make me unique,\nI'm a powerful hunter, strong and sleek.\nUnlike other cats, I love to swim,\nFinding me might test you to the rim!",
    hint: "Look for the striped cat that loves water!",
    difficulty: 'medium',
    points: 100,
    fact: "Tigers are the only big cats that truly love swimming!"
  },

  // HARD RIDDLES (Ages 12+)
  {
    id: 7,
    animal: 'Rhino',
    riddle: "My horn is not bone, but compressed hair so tight,\nI'm a herbivore giant with poor eyesight.\nThough I look prehistoric, I'm gentle at heart,\nConservation efforts give me a fresh start.",

  },
  {
    id: 9,
    animal: 'Snow Leopard',
    riddle: "In mountains so high where the air is thin,\nMy spotted coat helps my survival begin.\nMy tail's like a scarf, thick and so long,\nClimate change makes my future less strong.",
    hint: "Look for the ghost of the mountains!",
    difficulty: 'hard',
    points: 150,
    fact: "Snow leopards can't roar - they chuff, growl, and purr instead!"
  }
]
```

## **Step 3: Add Difficulty Selection**

### **Add Difficulty Chooser to Your App:**

**After the family name input, add difficulty selection.** Replace your welcome screen section with:

```javascript
  const [selectedDifficulty, setSelectedDifficulty] = useState('all')
  
  // Filter riddles by difficulty
  const getFilteredRiddles = () => {
    if (selectedDifficulty === 'all') return sampleRiddles
    return sampleRiddles.filter(riddle => riddle.difficulty === selectedDifficulty)
  }

  // Update the riddle access to use filtered riddles
  const filteredRiddles = getFilteredRiddles()
  const currentRiddle = filteredRiddles[currentRiddleIndex]
  const isLastRiddle = currentRiddleIndex >= filteredRiddles.length - 1

  if (!gameStarted) {
    return (
      <div className="min-h-screen bg-green-50 p-4">

    )
  }
```

# Section 4: Phase 2 Development - QR Code Integration

## **Overview**
Now we'll add the signature feature of Zoo Safari - QR code scanning! This transforms your riddle app from a manual "I Found It" system into a real treasure hunt where families must physically find and scan codes to prove they discovered the right animal.

## **What We're Adding in Phase 2**

✅ **QR code scanner** - Camera-based scanning with validation
✅ **QR code generation** - Create printable codes for testing
✅ **Answer validation** - Verify scans match current riddle
✅ **Enhanced user flow** - Riddle → Search → Scan → Success
✅ **Error handling** - Clear feedback for wrong/failed scans

---

## **Step 1: Install QR Code Scanning Library**

### **Add the QR Scanner Package:**

1. **Stop your development server** (press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal)
2. **Install the QR scanning library**:
   ```
   npm install @yudiel/react-qr-scanner
   ```
3. **Wait for installation to complete** (should take 30-60 seconds)
4. **Restart your server**:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## **Step 2: Add QR Scanner Component**

### **Update Your Imports:**

**At the top of your `src/app/page.js` file, update the imports:**

```javascript
'use client'
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

// Dynamically import QR scanner to avoid SSR issues
const QrScanner = dynamic(
  () => import('@yudiel/react-qr-scanner'),
  {
    ssr: false,
    loading: () => <p className="text-center text-gray-600">Loading camera...</p>
  }
)
```

### **Add QR Code Values to Riddles:**

**Update your `sampleRiddles` array to include QR codes for each animal:**

```javascript
// Add qrCode property to each riddle
const sampleRiddles = [
  // EASY RIDDLES (Ages 4-8)
  {
    id: 1,
    animal: 'Lion',
    riddle: "I'm big and yellow with a fluffy mane.\nI roar really loud - can you hear my refrain?\nI'm called the king, but I live on the ground.\nCan you find where my roar can be found?",
    hint: "Look for the biggest, loudest cat!",

    fact: "Snow leopards can't roar - they chuff, growl, and purr instead!",
    qrCode: "SNOW_LEOPARD_GHOST_SAFARI"
  }
]
```

---

## **Step 3: Add QR Scanner State and Functions**

### **Add New State Variables:**

**Add these to your existing useState declarations:**

```javascript
const [showScanner, setShowScanner] = useState(false)
const [scanResult, setScanResult] = useState('')
const [scanError, setScanError] = useState('')
```

**Your complete state section should now look like:**
```javascript
const [familyName, setFamilyName] = useState('')
const [gameStarted, setGameStarted] = useState(false)
const [currentPoints, setCurrentPoints] = useState(0)
const [discoveredAnimals, setDiscoveredAnimals] = useState([])
const [currentRiddleIndex, setCurrentRiddleIndex] = useState(0)
const [showHint, setShowHint] = useState(false)
const [showSuccess, setShowSuccess] = useState(false)
const [selectedDifficulty, setSelectedDifficulty] = useState('all')
const [showScanner, setShowScanner] = useState(false)
const [scanResult, setScanResult] = useState('')
const [scanError, setScanError] = useState('')
```

### **Add QR Scanning Functions:**

**Add these functions after your existing functions (like `startAdventure`, `foundAnimal`, etc.):**

```javascript
const openScanner = () => {
  setShowScanner(true)
  setScanError('')
}

const closeScanner = () => {
  setShowScanner(false)
  setScanResult('')
  setScanError('')
}

const handleScan = (result) => {
  if (result) {
    setScanResult(result)
    
    // Check if scanned code matches current riddle
    if (result === currentRiddle.qrCode) {
      // Correct answer! 
      setShowScanner(false)
      foundAnimal() // Use existing success logic
    } else {
      // Wrong code scanned
      setScanError(`That's not the right animal! You scanned: ${result}`)
      // Auto-close error after 3 seconds
      setTimeout(() => {
        setScanError('')
      }, 3000)
    }
  }
}

const handleScanError = (error) => {
  console.log('Scan error:', error)
  setScanError('Having trouble scanning? Make sure the QR code is clear and well-lit.')
}
```

---

## **Step 4: Update the Main Game Interface**

### **Replace the "I Found It" Button with QR Scanner Button:**

**In your main game return statement, replace the old "I Found It" button section with this new QR scanner section:**

```javascript
return (
  <div className="min-h-screen bg-green-50 p-4">

        {/* Hint Button */}
        {!showHint && (

        )}

        {/* Hint Display */}
        {showHint && (

## **Step 5: Test the QR Scanner**

### **Test Camera Access:**

1. **Save your files** and refresh the browser
2. **Start a family adventure** and get to the first riddle
3. **Click "Scan QR Code"**
4. **Allow camera access** when prompted by your browser
5. **You should see** a camera feed in the popup

### **Test with Any QR Code:**

**Create a simple test:**
1. **Go to**: https://www.qr-code-generator.com
2. **Enter text**: `LION_KING_SAFARI`
3. **Generate and display** the QR code on another device/screen
4. **Point your camera** at this QR code
5. **It should successfully** complete the lion riddle!

**✅ Success checkpoint: Camera opens and can scan QR codes!**

---

## **Step 6: Generate QR Codes for Home Testing**

### **Create QR Codes for All Animals:**

**Go to a QR code generator (like qr-code-generator.com) and create codes for each:**

**Easy Animals:**
- `LION_KING_SAFARI`
- `ELEPHANT_TRUNK_SAFARI` 
- `MONKEY_SWING_SAFARI`

**Medium Animals:**
- `GIRAFFE_TALL_SAFARI`
- `PENGUIN_SWIM_SAFARI`
- `TIGER_STRIPE_SAFARI`

**Hard Animals:**
- `RHINO_HORN_SAFARI`
- `ORANGUTAN_SMART_SAFARI`
- `SNOW_LEOPARD_GHOST_SAFARI`

### **Create Testing Signs:**

**Print these signs with the QR codes:**

```
🦁 LION KINGDOM
--------------------
Scan to discover the King of Beasts!
[QR Code: LION_KING_SAFARI]

🐘 ELEPHANT WATERING HOLE
--------------------------  
Scan to meet the gentle giants!
[QR Code: ELEPHANT_TRUNK_SAFARI]

🐵 MONKEY TREE HOUSE
---------------------
Scan to find the playful swingers!
[QR Code: MONKEY_SWING_SAFARI]

(etc. for all 9 animals)
```

---

## **Step 7: Test the Complete QR Flow**

### **Full Testing Process:**

1. **Place QR code signs** around your home testing area
2. **Start the app** and choose a difficulty level
3. **Read the riddle** and work with family to solve it
4. **Find the matching station** in your home
5. **Click "Scan QR Code"** button
6. **Allow camera access** 
7. **Point camera at QR code** until it scans
8. **Celebrate success!** and continue to next riddle

### **Test Error Scenarios:**

**Test wrong QR codes:**
- Try scanning the elephant QR code when on the lion riddle
- You should see an error message: "That's not the right animal!"

**Test camera issues:**
- Cover camera lens (should show scanning interface but not work)
- Try in different lighting conditions

**✅ Success checkpoint: Complete QR scan flow works from riddle to success celebration!**
